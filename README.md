# Expo with Op-Sqlite and Drizzle

This project demonstrates the integration of a Turso database with an Expo/React Native app using op-sqlite, configured to use libSQL as the database source.

By leveraging Tursoâ€™s embedded replicas, the setup enables fast local reads from a SQLite database while write operations are sent to the remote database and automatically synced back to the local replica.
